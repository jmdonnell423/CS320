# CS320
This repository is a reflection of my coursework in CS320 Software Test Automation and QA. The following coursework was a mock assignment from a software engineer for Grand Strand Systems, a software engineering company that focuses on developing and testing back-end services. The project was completed entirely by me along with the test case scenarios. 

The requirements were met and exceeded and a reflection of the project is included. The learning of how to create test cases for each individual line of code showed how important QA and testing is to the completion of any project.
